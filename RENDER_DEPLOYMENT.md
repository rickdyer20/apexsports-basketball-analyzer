## Part 3: Verify Deployment

### Step 7: Test Your App

1. **Once deployed**, Render will show you the URL (like `https://basketball-shot-analyzer.onrender.com`)
2. **Click the URL** to open your Basketball Shot Analyzer
3. **Test key features**:
   - Upload a basketball shot video
   - Verify shot analysis works
   - Check that frame labeling displays properly
   - Test the enhanced elbow detection

### Step 8: Troubleshooting (If Needed)

**If deployment fails:**
1. **Check build logs** in Render dashboard
2. **Common issues**:
   - Missing dependencies â†’ Check `requirements.txt`
   - Port binding errors â†’ Verify start command uses `$PORT`
   - Memory issues â†’ Consider upgrading to paid plan if needed

**If app loads but doesn't work:**
1. **Check application logs** in Render dashboard
2. **Test locally first** to ensure app works on localhost:8501
3. **Check file paths** - use relative paths only
